* Basics

+ Vim keybindings =:w=, =:q=, =:wqa= etc still work to save + close.
+ =SPC w v= / =SPC w s= to split window vertically / horizontally.

* Org

+ =SPC := is =M-x= â€” that opens context menu where you can type in a function name if you don't know the keybinding (e.g., =org-babel-tangle=)
+ =SPC X= to =org-capture=

* TODOs

[ ] Update styling so that selected text is more visually distinct
